## Completion Time Estimation

Honestly ask yourself, when did you last read the Holy Quran? 
This is a big shame for me, for us, for our community.

We have hundreds of thousands problems in our life, but the solution is here, in the Holy Quran. Let's read, and let others read. 
For an average desk job person working 7 hours/day:
- Total verses: 6,236
- Daily verses (minimum): 7
- Estimated completion time: ~891 days (~2.5 years)

Increase your reading frequency to complete sooner!
